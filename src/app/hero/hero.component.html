      <h2 >The ROI Calculator</h2>
      <br>
      <h4>
        To assist industry in assessing the cost benefit of implementing the hydrogen unit, a return on investment calculator has been developed. The application calculates possible savings should the hydrogen unit be installed in a particular industrial process.
      </h4>
      <br>
      <p>
        To utilise the calculator users are required to input data on a range of factors relevant to their processes. These include type of fuel currently used, price of the fuel, value of the oxygen and level of carbon tax currently being paid.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        The calculator takes into account the available energy of the installation site and calculates the number of electrolysers that can be installed, their costs and the water requirements. Finally it calculates the estimated hydrogen and oxygen production. Given this information, it is possible to calculate the fuel saving, the carbon tax reduction as a result of CO2 emission savings and potential earnings through the oxygen production.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Based on these calculations the calculator is able to offset the savings and earnings against the costs of the units to predict an expected return on investment for the industrial process.
